<p>Title: Some users may experience multiple issues with their Microsoft Teams <br /><br />User impact: Users may experience multiple issues with their Microsoft Teams. <br /><br />More info: Affected scenarios include, but aren&#39;t limited to the following: <br /><br />Mitigated/improving: <br /><br />- [Updated] Users logging in or unlocking their devices after some time may have missing messages. We believe that this symptom has been addressed. <br />- [Updated] Users may have been unable to load messages in channels and chats. We believe that this symptom has been addressed. <br />- [Updated] Users were unable to view or download their media (images, videos, audio, call recordings, code snippets). We believe that this symptom has been addressed. <br />- [Updated] Some users were experiencing delays sending and receiving chat messages. We believe this symptom has been largely addressed, though some users may still experience brief delays. <br />- [Updated] Anonymous users may be unable to join meetings. We’re seeing improvement in this area but some users may still be affected by this scenario. <br />- [Updated] Teams connectors for Power Automate/Power Apps were experiencing errors. We believe that this symptom has been addressed. <br />- [Updated] Call Recordings might take longer to appear in user&#39;s OneDrive for Business and SharePoint Online. This symptom has been addressed. <br /><br />Still affected/undergoing further evaluation: <br /><br />- Users may be unable to load previous Copilot history, or new history is not written <br />- Bots may be unable to download attachments <br />- Sending and receiving read receipt notifications may be delayed <br />- Users may experience issues resuming or rejoining meetings. <br />- Users within organizations leveraging an Information Barrier may experience issues joining meetings <br />- Users performing a cold boot may not be able to log into teams and will see an &#34;oops&#34; page <br /><br />Current status: We’re seeing significant improvements with many of the Teams features affected by this incident as we continue to apply mitigations and optimize traffic. We’re evaluating the remaining impact scenarios and are developing fixes and workstreams to address all lingering impact associated with this event. Please see the “more info” section above for the latest information on each impact scenario. <br /><br />We understand the impact an issue like this can have on your organization, and we appreciate your partnership and patience as we work to remediate this issue. <br /><br />Scope of impact: This issue can potentially impact any Microsoft Teams user in the scenarios outlined in the More info section. <br /><br />Start time: Friday, January 26, 2024 at 9:55 AM EST <br />. <br /><br />Next update by: Friday, January 26, 2024 at 9:30 PM EST</p>

<p>This issue affects users who need to access network elements on Lumen through the workspace. <br />This requires the 4.12 version of Citrix. <br />If users don&#39;t need to access Lumen elements, they can upgrade to 22.10.0.21.</p>

<p>There is a workaround for this: <br />Users will need to run their brightspeed Chrome and their Brightspeed applications out of Citrix via the browser (lite version). <br />A reboot is also required.</p>

<p>Options: 1) Rollback change from this morning; 2) Implement limit increase ; 3) Reduce prefixes in VPC at the same time as the implement</p>

<p>To bring the platform back, the change from this morning will be rolled back, however, to bring back Network Prod, a good amount of prefixes need to be removed. A flush from the Google side will coincide with the rollback.</p>

<p>Per Bill Middleton: immediately after restarting it was working and then within just a few minutes it went back into a state where we couldn&#39;t connect to the database. <br />Connection pooling and the error we&#39;re getting is connection is not available. <br />Yet when viewing the process list, to not see any queries running and other services seem to be able to connect to the database OK. <br />So it seems it seems to be limited to just Job InfoManager service. <br />Team hasn&#39;t pushed code to the service since February 26th. <br />And do not believe we made any database changes with changes Friday night that would affect this.</p>

<p>Anuj re-joined the call. <br />It seems to be the apprehending the issue <br />We are taking few quick measures right now. <br />We don&#39;t know why suddenly this impact is going on our database. <br />So we are at this point as we are talking, we are adding few more items - more indexes and query improvement in our database. <br />We are hoping that those changes will give us a relief. <br />I&#39;ve added Bill (Middleton) from my team here on this call. <br />We are creating an emergency change - we are confident that these changes what we are making right now will give us a good breather.</p>

<p>Patait, Anuj10:17 AM <br />Yeah, in last 15 minutes we we just cleared it. <br />So it&#39;s not much time that we have cleared the queue. <br />So you might see a little bit improvement and it should be better later on. <br />* <br />Jason Eckert checking with vendors to confirm latency has cleared. <br />Awaiting Tim Randall confirmation that latency has cleared.</p>

<p>Patait, Anuj10:16 AM <br />It is going through Lumen system, but eventually it&#39;s coming to us and all those are related to the issue that we have raised in the morning that lumen dispatch system has created uncertain tons of routine at 5:00 AM in the morning, which was our busiest time. <br />We are coordinating with lumen to see like how we can delay those routine jobs and dispatch creations. <br />It seems like it&#39;s a monthly job which happens and that&#39;s why we saw that behavior last month as well <br />And on the 1st of January 2, so we are working with lumen to ensure that those routines should get created at the night time and at the same time we are adding few more indexes and all those things on dispatch wrapper side to see the improvement in the performance. <br />But as of now, from last 15 minutes or so should see the experience is better because we have cleared our backlog now.</p>

<p>Summary of troubleshooting (Priya Nivarthi) <br />As part of the change request event that started last night, there were two things taking place: <br />-multiple applications that were connected to Oracle metal servers, DB servers, the one that was primary was swapped with the HA DB server so that today a firmware upgrade on the primary could take place. <br />-once the firm ware upgrade completed tonight, the team would swap back to primary. <br />* <br />As part of the swap last night when we swapped the primary and HA, it seems like the primary DB server was not brought down. <br />So somewhere in the application it was still trying to connect to the primary even though it was swapped out. <br />Infrastructure team (Satish) completely shut down the primary that was taken out, that was swapped out last night. <br />Now the application is forced to connect to the HDB server and it is working fine.</p>

<p>Brightspeed Team asking Straviso if there there are any alarm or anything set up for those cache issues <br />Straviso to make sure that we had an alarm set up that if we don&#39;t return the API, are they URL in cache to generate alerts.</p>

<p>Report from Brian McCarthy, Straviso: <br />Found a potential issue with the cache on one of the 8 pods. <br />When we would go to cache to try and get the API endpoint URL, it wasn&#39;t retrieving anything and it was sending those jobs into archive. <br />Refreshed cache about 5 minutes ago and are monitoring for any more recurrences. <br />Requesting Brightspeed Support team to validate any new occurrences.</p>

<p>Brightspeed Support Team has identified, and Straviso also figured out whenever we are doing bulk status update, the first job of that status update is fine and it is staying as accepted, but all other subsequent jobs which were there as part of that list, those are getting archived.</p>

<p>Summary: <br />116 jobs have been sync&#39;d that were the result of this issue with archiving - giving the Techs the jobs to continue working. <br />Straviso continues to look for root cause on another bridge. <br />Anuj Patait confirmed there were no planned changes over the weekend to infrastructure/application. <br />Straviso reporting they have not changed anything as well. <br />Support team have fixed what they saw being archived which were not supposed to be archived. <br />Issue only happening when technicians are doing bulk update, so if they will do individual updates on the job, they should work fine</p>

<p>Support teams reporting issue began around 9:00AEST <br />Vendor Straviso is working root cause. <br />In the meantime, teams are proactively taking steps to keep Techs working. <br />- First step is like we are manually syncing the job in tech X database so that technician can see it again <br />-Second thing that we are doing is we are sending a broadcast message to all the technicians not to bulk update the job until we find the root cause and fix it <br />-Straviso also working on root cause.</p>

Glen Schultz</strong></p><p>AM update from MS - Service: Virtual Machines<br />Region: East US<br />Impact Statement: Starting at 22:35 UTC on 19 Jun to 16:30 UTC on 20 Jun 2024, customers using Virtual Machines / Virtual Machines Scale Sets in East US who may have received error notifications when performing service management operations - such as create, delete, update, scaling, start, stop - for resources hosted in this region. <br />The failures have subsided and customers should not be experiencing any more allocation failures. However, we are aware of capacity constraints in East US Zone 2 (Az2) affecting Intel and AMD general-purpose VM sizes, this issue was exacerbated by an issue that was impacting our allocator service. This issue has been mitigated, however we acknowledge that it is possible for customers to observe provisioning errors with the following SKUs. Dasv5, Dadsv5, DDSv5, Dasv4, Dsv5, DDsv5, LSv3, Easv5, Dsv4, Easv4, BS, Dsv4, Dv2, Av2, Eadsv5, Esv5.<br />Customer workaround<br />While constraints are impacting the region, we know that AZ2 is more constrained than other availability zones in the region. As a result, customers are advised to move VMs to either AZ1 or AZ3. If services across three availability zones are necessary, deploying resources to East US 2 is also an option for customers.<br />Please refer to this documentation to understand the logical to physical availability zone mapping for your subscription: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/subscriptions/list-locations?view&#61;rest-resources-2022-12-01&amp;tabs&#61;HTTP<br />Current workstreams<br />·       We are undergoing efforts to reclaim capacity in Zone 2, with immediate consumption of reclaimed resources.<br />·       We are restoring capacity by bringing in some of our offline nodes back to production.<br />·       We are evicting internal non-production workloads to alleviate pressure and release capacity.<br />·       We expect that new capacity will be brought online by the end of July 2024.<br />·       The next update for this event will be on the 7 of July with a status update.</p><p> </p><p><strong>INC0099231 .

Glen Schultz</strong></p><p>From Everett :  Bringing IT Leadership upto speed on the Virtual Desktop Issues affecting your Dev Teams.  T<br />here is a regional outage in Azure East where all of our Citrix Virtual Desktops live.  There is no ETR for this outage from Microsoft.  As the largest and most critical Business User of Citrix we have moved the Call Centers to Azure West and they are operating out of that datacenter. The primary remaining impact is to privileged IT Desktops.  The IT Desktops cannot be moved because they are persistent and it would take many weeks to build out and migrate the desktops.  We are in a DR situation at this point and are reliant on Microsoft to get the VDI Resources back online.  We have SevA case open with them, we have escalated, and they cannot give us an ETR.   Some work arounds to consider is using  BeyondTrust to access the day1 Jump Boxes.  Dev&#39;s sign into their desktop early AM when VDI resources are available, and keep them active during the day.  Do not logout or reboot your desktop, because it is not guaranteed to be able to restart.   Here is a screenshot of the service health bulletin from Microsoft for awareness.  We expect Microsoft to fix this issue quickly as it is impacting all customers in Azure East US.  I know we are all under major time pressures to deliver, and I really appreciate you and your teams patience while we work through this situation</p><p> </p><p><strong>INC0099231 .

<p>[4:49 AM] Thien Mai (External) <br />In the call today, we will clean redis data related to websocket and test again. Then we will look into details of some redis data. In case of no luck, can we have a chance to deploy new patch on BrightSpeed dev env. The patch is to include more helpful logging to ease troubleshooting, nothing else. It will tell us code flow that leads to the failure, and print more helpful info around the failure.</p>

<p>Bypassing Apigee did not resolve the issue and BOSS-OM team can still see the errors. <br />AXON is still unable to reproduce this issue in their environment using the same BOSS OM code. <br />AXON team gathered the logs from Brightspeed and will review again. <br />The teams will reconvene at 08:00A ET tomorrow morning. <br />Chat communication can continue if Axon Team have questions for Brightspeed.</p>

Glen Schultz</strong></p><p>There has been an update on the revocation timing update. Please see the below:<br />DigiCert have been actively engaged with the CA/Browser Forum (CABF) and the customers impacted by this incident. Many of these customers have been able to reissue their certificates. Unfortunately, several other customers operating critical infrastructure, vital telecommunications networks, cloud services, and healthcare industries are not in a position to have all their certificates reissued and deployed in time, without critical service interruptions. <br />To avoid disruption to critical services, we have engaged with members of the browser community alongside our customers over the last several hours. Based on these discussions, we are now in a position to postpone revocation by an additional 96 hours, where required.  <br />All impacted certificates will now be revoked no later than Saturday, August 3rd, 2024, 19:30 UTC. DigiCert will follow the standard CABF process for delayed revocations. All impacted customers will be notified by email in the next few hours.</p><p> </p><p><strong>INC0106317 .

<p>Bridge has resumed for Infrastructure and DT bridge shut down as they have to follow the instructions or call the ITSD for assistance - Bit locker key. Infrastructure says all PROD apps are restored and they are using Rubrik to restore 10 PROD servers at a time (mainly the rest of PROD that are backend tools). After they finish PROD they will attack lower environments.</p>

<p>Requested that Jared White add all users to the &#34;Microsoft Entra Joined Device Local Administrator&#34; role which will grant them local admin on all Win 10/11 endpoints. This will not include Citrix, only domain-joined devices. This was approved by Sharman Sibia and will be removed once the outage is over.</p>

<p>Tim Randall Status: <br />So on the other call, we were working on a bunch of different things. <br />First thing was the team removed the recaptcha to try to see if that resolved the 429 error that we were seeing and it did not. <br />So then they went through and bounced a few of the GCP services and then we&#39;re all of a sudden seeing the get calls and everything flow through APIGEE properly. <br />But now the team is going to add recapture back in and see if that breaks things again or not. <br />So that&#39;ll take another four or five minutes, but we were successful getting quals and everything back right now being able to get into the buyflows for the different channels.</p>
